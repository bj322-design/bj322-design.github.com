                        &emsp;&emsp;My name is Brandon Schadoff, I am currently 17 years old and attend 
                        <br>Wantagh High School as a senior. I recently applied under the major of computer science to the schools of:
                        <br>&emsp;1. SUNY Binghamton
                        <br>&emsp;2. SUNY Albany
                        <br>&emsp;3. SUNY New Paltz<br>&emsp;4. SUNY Polytechnic<br>&emsp;5. SUNY Stony Brook

                        <u><b>>Why I am interested in Computer Science:</u></b>
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Knowing how to code, I feel, gives anyone an advantage. This advantage can be translated to solve complex problems and incorporate vital communication and teamwork skills.

                        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I became interested in computer science and computer programming as a result of two events. 

                        <br><br>&emsp;The first event, was joining the Computer Science Club of Wantagh Middle School. This club and its advisor, Mrs.O’Connor, introduced me to computer science. I have since discovered that I have a strong interest in learning and exploring coding not just as a hobby but as a future career.                        
                        <br>&emsp;The second event, was a 24 hour coding competition at New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). Even though at that time I knew so little about programming I was determined to learn as much as I could. I attended many of the seminars they held over the 24 hours about future jobs, coding languages, modding Minecraft, and even some impacts that Computer Science had on people’s lives. This one event showed me how much I need to and want to learn about the industry and programming as a whole. There is always something new to learn and explore when it comes to programming. New algorithms and new more efficient ways of completing tasks are always appearing and changing the way in which we live our lives.
                        <br><br><br><br><br><u><b>>Coding Languages I Know:</b></u>
                        <br>&emsp;Java
                        <br>&emsp;HTML
                        <br>&emsp;CSS
                        <br>&emsp;Python
                        <br><br><u><b>>Coding Experience:</b></u>
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;During my 11th grade in Wantagh High School, I enrolled in AP Computer Science in which I learned object oriented programming with Java. The Class is equivalent to a first semester introductory college course, or computer science 101. During the class we learned how to make classes, methods, arrays, and other fundamentals needed to write Java programs. I received a 3 on the AP Computer Science Exam at the end of the course.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Over the Summer of 2021, I registered to take the python programming 101 course through the University of Michigan. In this course, I learned how to solve complex math equations, graph functions similar to that of a calculator, write algorithms, and write an app that allows the user to place a basic lens over a picture - such as putting sunglasses on a face or cat. I received a certificate of completion at the end of the course.
