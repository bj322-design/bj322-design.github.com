                        <br>Wantagh High School as a senior. I recently applied under the major of computer science to the schools of:
                        <br>&emsp;1. SUNY Binghamton
                        <br>&emsp;2. SUNY Albany

                        <u><b>>Why I am interested in Computer Science:</u></b>
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in computer science as I think it is the future of technology as our reliance on it is ever growing. Knowing how to code, I feel, gives anyone an advantage to solve problems not just in math but also gives you vital communication and teamwork skills. This is due to the fact that you need to work effectively with colleges to accomplish the necessary tasks to allow the program to run as it should. 
                        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I became interested in computer science and computer programming as a result of two events. 
                        <br><br>&emsp;The first, was a result of joining the Computer Science Club of Wantagh Middle School. This club and its advisor, Mrs.O’Connor, showed me that I truly have an interest in learning and exploring coding not just as a hobby but as a future job. 
                        <br>&emsp;The second, was a 24 hour coding competition at New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). Even though at that time I knew so little about programming I was determined to learn as much as I could. I attended many of the seminars they held over the 24 hours about future jobs, coding languages, modding minecraft, and even some impacts that Computer Science had on people’s lives. This one event showed me how much I need to and want to learn about the industry and programming as a whole. There is always something new to learn and something new to always explore when it comes to programming. New Algorithms and new, more efficient, ways of completing the same task are always appearing and changing the way in which we live our lives. 
                        
                        <br><br><u><b>>Coding Languages I Know:</b></u>
                        <br>&emsp;Java
                        <br>&emsp;HTML
                        <br>&emsp;CSS
                        <br>&emsp;Python
                        <br><br><u><b>>Coding Experience:</b></u>
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;During my 11th grade in Wantagh High School, I enrolled in AP Computer Science in which I learned object oriented programming with Java. The Class is equivalent to a first-semester introductory college course, or computer science 101. During the class we learned how to make classes, methods, arrays, and other fundamentals needed to write Java programs. I received a 3 on the AP Computer Science Exam at the end of the course. 
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Over the Summer of 2021 I registered to take the python programming 101 course through the University of Michigan. In this course I learned how to solve complex math equations, graph functions similar to that of a calculator, write an algorithm, and write an app that allows you to place a basic lens to a picture - such as putting sunglasses on a face or cat - using the python programming language.
