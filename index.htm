			<p2><b>I am currently taking AP Computer Science with Mr. Walsh. When I go to college I am planning on majoring in <i><u>Computer Science</u></i>. For the summer I am taking a course, through the University of Michigan. In this course I will be learning Python and how to develop web apps. In addition, I am also going to look at SUNY schools over the summer: <b><b1>Poly Tech</b1>, <b2>Binghamton</b2>, <b3>New Paltz</b3>,</b> and <b><b4>Albany</b4></b>.
