                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Ever since I saw a 3D printer when I was 10, I was fascinated by the technology and the opportunities that came with it. Later that year I started basic designing 3d objects. After a few years I finally got myself a 3D printer of my own. I designed and built many small and useful parts that I use in my house everyday. For instance, designed and printed a custom headphone holder for my desk, a towel hanger spacer for my bathroom door, and a gasket for my dad's convertible top. Without 3D printing these parts could cost almost hundreds in the case of the gasket - it is a rare part that isn't in production anymore.
